Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth.[13][14] It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, 
but with its larger volume Saturn is over 95 times more massive.[15][16][17] Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; 
its astronomical symbol (â™„) represents the god's sickle.
